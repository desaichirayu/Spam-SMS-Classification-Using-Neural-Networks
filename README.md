# Spam-SMS-Classification-Using-Neural-Networks

A mini-project on using Multilayer Perceptrons to classify Messages

The files prepare_input_data.py and prepare_test_data.py are used to prepare the data for the code

The logic for multilayer perceptron spam classifier is in multilayer_perceptron_classifier.py

Note: All files assume that the files to which the path has been given in their methods exist in the same directory.
